===== TO DO =====

- submit button for draw.html needs to pass form input to backend properly

- mathpix.py needs to parse complex numbers. in python, they are represented as follows: 1+3j

- some of the operations return true or false. Make sure that those work when rendering results.html

- fix font colors

- fix dropdown in upload.html and I think draw.html to make it look like type.html

- make dropdown at the top instead of bottom

- update README (include packages to pip install)

- update operations.html to include all functions
