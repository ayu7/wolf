Basic redirection in app.py
- Need more clarification on how input from html will be to create
  submission functions
- Will look at image submission work from previous projects for help

Basic Mathpix API call in mathpix.py
- Need to figure out standard for LaTex conversion

Finished Matrix/Vector Conversion
- Converts LaTex matrices to 2D arrays
- Converts LaTex vectors to arrays

alanC -- 2017-05-14
- Set up basic HTML templates (home.html, type.html)
- Discussed upload methods for upload.html

angelaY -- 2017-05-15
- Began work on draw.js & added things in draw.html in order to test
- Adapted work from canvas, concept: animate while mousedown then stop when mouse up
- Does not work :(

stephanieY -- 2017-05-15
- Added bootstrap to static
- Rewrote home.html to use bootstrap, modified content.
- Need to make another page to list out operations.
- Added basic.html (that way the other templates can extend basic.html)
- Wrote operations.html with sample text (a page that informs the user what operations are supported by wolframBeta) but need to actually edit content later.
- working on type.html

juliusF -- 2017-05-15
- Working on matrix filter
- Retroactive devlog fix

angelaY -- 2017-05-15
- functional drag and draw but there are gaps if you go to fast
- attempting to fix by keeping track of prevX and prevY

alanC -- 2017-05-15
- Fix dropdown in type.html
- Begin bootstrap templating type.html, upload.html

stephanieY -- 2017-05-16
- Finished Gaussian elimination, rank, invertibility, and check for Hermitian matrix! Feeling good about this. The rest of the operations are optional!

angelaY -- 2017-05-20
- complete functional canvas drawing (used lines instead of rectangles)

alanC -- 2017-05-20
- Finish templating (type.html, operations.html, upload.html)
- Update list of operations in operations.html

stephanieY -- 2017-05-21
- basis of a rowspace/columnspace of a matrix, nullity, nullspace (for square matrix)

angelaY -- 2017-05-21
- implemented second input canvas
- finished javascript for hiding/displaying two canvases

alanC --2017-05-21
- Revert to working dropdown menu (need to fix bootstrap version)
- Update name attribute in input tags - request.form working properly

angelaY -- 2017-05-22
- changed javascript to fit the new dropdown menu
- integrated javascript for upload.html and type.html so the number of inputs changes

juliusF -- 2017-05-22
- retroactive devlog updates
  - just worked on the matrix filter the whole time
- created basic connection from front end to back end through type.html
  - must check amount of arguments given
  - currently only works with \\begin{array} format due to inflexibility of matrixConvert() in mathpix.py

alanC -- 2017-05-22
- add hyperlinks to operations.html

juliusF -- 2017-05-23
- expanded operations type.html can pass through to backend
- generalized matrix converter
- must sanitize/check input
  - input is actually matrix syntax
  - input is in the correct spot/field

alanC -- 2017-05-23
- add todo.txt to keep track of needed fixes
- adjust textbox size in type.html
- integrate bootstrap into upload.html/draw.html

angelaY -- 2017-05-24
- working on passing canvas content into flask app
- converted into URL but not sure what's happening??
Debugging of Front end
- removed bootstrap class of button from draw.html, instead it is dynamically added in draw.js
- not sure why input type="file" does not hide with hidden attribute, used style display instead (it works but the issue is perplexing)

juliusF -- 2017-05-25
- sidetracked/set aside sanitization/input verification/checks
- finished array to latex array to mathjax converters

stephanieY -- 2017-05-25
- fixed vector() and matrix()
- wrote up test_input.txt
- wrote up todo.txt
- renamed math.py as linalg.py

angelaY -- 2017-05-25

juliusF -- 2017-05-31
- Getting image uploading going
- Nearly finished with checker
- Image uploading passes to middleware, need to clean up backend parsing

angelaY -- 2017-06-01
- drew white background for canvases so that image renders properly for mathpix

stephanieY -- 2017-06-03
- added testImages directory with one picture
- update README
- made keys.txt and keyz(x) function, updated queryFPath and queryURI functions accordingly
- updated functions in mathpix.py to check if output is a float
