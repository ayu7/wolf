Basic redirection in app.py
- Need more clarification on how input from html will be to create
  submission functions
- Will look at image submission work from previous projects for help

Basic Mathpix API call in mathpix.py
- Need to figure out standard for LaTex conversion

Finished Matrix/Vector Conversion
- Converts LaTex matrices to 2D arrays
- Converts LaTex vectors to arrays

- Set up basic HTML templates (home.html, type.html)
- Discussed upload methods for upload.html

angelaY -- 2017-05-15
- Began work on draw.js & added things in draw.html in order to test
- Adapted work from canvas, concept: animate while mousedown then stop when mouse up
- Does not work :(

stephanieY -- 2017-05-15
- Added bootstrap to static
- Rewrote home.html to use bootstrap, modified content.
- Need to make another page to list out operations.
- Added basic.html (that way the other templates can extend basic.html)
- Wrote operations.html with sample text (a page that informs the user what operations are supported by wolframBeta) but need to actually edit content later.
- working on type.html

juliusF -- 2017-05-15
- Working on matrix filter
- Retroactive devlog fix
