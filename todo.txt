===== TO DO =====

- basic results.html
  - render input and output
  - show/hide latex

- jinja for results.html
  -> how to pass "print mathOps()" to html
     -> how to parse passed data and make pretty

- custom.css needed

- submit button for draw.html needs to pass form input to backend properly

- draw.html and upload.html need to hide elements correctly

- mathpix.py needs to parse complex numbers. in python, they are represented as follows: 1+3j

- some of the operations return true or false. Make sure that those work wend rendering results.html

- test the operations

- update README (include packages to pip install)

===== FIXES NEEDED =====
- upload.html
  -> center dropdown menu with less jank (how to manipulate columns
     so the menu doesnt span the whole width)
