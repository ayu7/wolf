===== TO DO =====

- basic results.html

- jinja for results.html
  -> how to pass "print mathOps()" to html
     -> how to parse passed data and make pretty

- custom.css needed


===== FIXES NEEDED =====
- upload.html
  -> input2 does not hide if type="file" (hides if type="text")
  -> center dropdown menu with less jank (how to manipulate columns
     so the menu doesnt span the whole width)

- type.html
  -> input2 does not hide if bootstrap class is added
     (works rn, does not work with "class=form-control input-lg")


- draw.html
  -> clear1 does not hide if bootstrap class is added
     (does not hide if class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" is added)
