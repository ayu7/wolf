===== TO DO =====

- basic results.html
  - render input and output
  - show/hide latex

- jinja for results.html
  -> how to pass "print mathOps()" to html
     -> how to parse passed data and make pretty

- custom.css needed

- submit button for draw.html needs to pass form input to backend properly

- mathpix.py needs to parse complex numbers. in python, they are represented as follows: 1+3j

- some of the operations return true or false. Make sure that those work when rendering results.html

- pass operation as a jinja variable for results.html

- fix font colors

- fix dropdown in upload.html and I think draw.html to make it look like type.html

- make dropdown at the top instead of bottom

- update README (include packages to pip install)

===== FIXES NEEDED =====
- upload.html
  -> center dropdown menu with less jank (how to manipulate columns
     so the menu doesnt span the whole width)
- draw.html
  -> the mathpix can read the picture but nothing gets passed to results
