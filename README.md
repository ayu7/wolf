Final project

Our idea is to make a linear algebra calculator that will give the user step-by-step solutions to otherwise time-consuming and tedious calculations. What makes it particularly intuitive to use is that the calculator will take input in three easy ways: LaTeX source code, uploaded pictures, and canvas drawings. Moreover, the calculator will not only display the steps in the solution, but it will also provide the LaTeX source code for each.
