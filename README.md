Final project

Our idea is to make a linear algebra calculator that will give the user step-by-step solutions to otherwise time-consuming and tedious calculations. What makes it particularly intuitive to use is that the calculator will take input in three easy ways: LaTeX source code, uploaded pictures, and canvas drawings. Moreover, the calculator provides the LaTeX source code for each.
